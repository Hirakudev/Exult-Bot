> Discord ToS are a set of guidelines that every server and user on Discord must abide by. We, as a community on Discord's platform, are subject to enforcing these guidelines. One of the most important terms is that you must be over the age of 13.
> *Terms of Service can be read [here](https://discord.com/terms).*

> 'Not Safe For Work' Content will not be tolerated on this server. If you are believed to have sent any content that falls under the NSFW category, you will be banned. It has no place on this server. Unless in Nsfw Testing **only**.

> Our Discord Staff volunteers their time to keep the server safe, we kindly ask that you do not harass them (whether that be in channels or DMs) even if you need their attention. There are official routes of reporting an issue, and these do not include spamming staff. A similar thing goes for the Exult Team, please treat them with respect! The Exult Team try to interact with members, but in periods when they cannot, it is likely down to them working on our latest project (which requires them to concentrate), however, you will always be able to get support when needed!

> Profanity is allowed within reason, however, it is prohibited if used towards someone. Any Slurs against ANY Group will not be tolerated, these will result in an immediate ban. All other profanity will be assessed on an individual basis by a member of the Moderation Team and if found to be used inappropriately, you will be punished.

> Please avoid Political discussions as well as discussions that may offend. We politely ask that the server remains to the point and that we don't drift away into subjects that will potentially offend.

> Our Discord Staffs are here to prevent conflicts amongst members (amongst other things). To do this, they need your cooperation. When a Moderator tells you to do something, please do it. If you believe this is wrong, then you can take this up in the appropriate manner (information on how to do this can be found [here](https://discord.com/channels/912148314223415316/913121181442375730/970810984564416512)).

> We all share the same collective aims, to stay safe and to have fun. If you see something that doesn't look right or makes you feel uncomfortable, then please let us know by contacting the Discord Staff in the way set out here). Enjoy your time here and we hope you have fun!
